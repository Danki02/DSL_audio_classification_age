# Notebook Overview

The notebook of the project is divided into six main sections:

1. **Install**
    - Contains all cells to install all packages anche imports all libraries used in the code

2. **Analysis**
    - **Functions**: Includes functions for data analysis and exploration.

3. **Preprocessing**
    - **Functions**: Contains functions for data preprocessing tasks.
    - **Interfaces**: Provides interfaces to execute the preprocessing functions.

4. **Training and Evaluation**
    - **Functions**: Includes functions for training the model and evaluating its performance.
    - **Interfaces**: Lists the interfaces to run the training and evaluation functions.

5. **Finetuning**
    - **Functions**: Contains functions for fine-tune the model.
    - **Interfaces**: Provides interfaces to execute the finetuning functions.

6. **Plot**
    - **Functions**: Includes functions for plotting and visualizing results.
    - **Interfaces**: Lists the interfaces to run the plotting functions.

To interact with the model, open the interfaces subsections where all instructions for run the model are set, you need only to change paths
